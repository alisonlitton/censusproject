Project 1 ( Census )
Project Proposal

Team Members:
Alison Litton, Charlie Martinez, Kristi Mar, Matthew Hutcherson, Minerva Banuelos
Project Scope: To find the best and worst state in the US (based on factors presented in our dataset)
Datasets:
US Census Demographic Data (2015 & 2017)
Purpose:
Our project is to determine what is the best state and worst state to live in the U.S. We will examine factors such as unemployment rates, income per capita, poverty rates, population and so on. We will use two different datasets to answer our questions. We will use the US Census Demographic Data (2015, 2017) to uncover the best/worst states. We may consider pulling other data such as school rankings, average rate of mortgage/rent, life expectancy, and crime rates. 
Hypothesis:
Going into the project we predict that the best state could be determined best by higher income per capita, shorter commute times, and lower poverty rates.
Null: The state with a higher income per capita would mean a lower poverty rate.
Alternative: Income per capita would have no effect on the state’s poverty rate.
