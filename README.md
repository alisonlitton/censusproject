Project 1 ( Census )
Project Proposal

Team Members:
Alison Litton, Charlie Martinez, Kristi Mar, Matthew Hutcherson, Minerva Banuelos
Project Scope: To find the best state in the US (based on factors presented in our dataset)

Datasets:
US Census Demographic Data (2015 & 2017)

Purpose:
Our project is to determine what is the best state state to live in the U.S. We will examine factors such as unemployment rates, income, poverty rates, population and so on. We will use two different datasets to answer our questions. We will use the US Census Demographic Data (2015, 2017) to uncover the best states. We may consider pulling other data such as school rankings, average rate of mortgage/rent, life expectancy, and crime rates if time allows. 

Hypothesis:
Going into the project we predict that the best state could be determined best by higher income, shorter commute times, and lower poverty rates.
Null: The state with a higher income would mean a lower poverty rate.
Alternative: Income would have no effect on the stateâ€™s poverty rate.
